    18	*
    19	*  This program takes user input on what type of calculation should be done with 1
    20	*  Being for an inscribed triangle, 2 for an inscribed square, and any other number for circle inscribed
    21	*  in a polygon with that number of sides. The user also enters the area of the figure (circle for 1 and 2
    22	*  and a polygon for 3) and the program calculates the apothem/radius and area of the inscribed figure
