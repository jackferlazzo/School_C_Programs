    19	*  This program allows the user to selec whether a regular polygon is inscribed
    20	*  inside of a circle or the circle is inscribed inside of a regular polygon and 
    21	*  calculates the circle radius, circle area, polygon area, and the side length
    22	*  given user inputted number of polygon sides and apothem length
