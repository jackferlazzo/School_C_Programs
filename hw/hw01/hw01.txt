If the above is incorrect, you are responsible for resubmitting the assignment or seeking assistance from a course staff member prior to the due date! Assignments will never be accepted by e-mail.

If this is for a lab assignment, only one member must be designated to make a submission for the group.  Graders will not evaluate submissions from multiple group members to determine which effort you actually want graded.

    19	*  The user enters the the mass of a gilder and airplane in kg and the
    20	*  forward thrust produced by the propellers in N. This program then 
    21	*  calculates the resulting tension on the cable conneting the two aircraft
    22	*  and the acceleration of the glider
